# Unity-Strike
A simple game made in Java, with LWJGL and Slick. First time making an actual project with Java and GitHub, doing my best!

Unity-Strike is going to be a 2d, side scrolling sci-fi action game.

Currently there have been no releases yet, as I have just started working on it and I am not the fastest programmer! :)
