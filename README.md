#Operation Solar Fury

###About
Operation Solar Fury is going to be a ~~2D, side scrolling~~ 3D? sci-fi shooter like game, built in Java with OpenGl/LWJGL3.

I am going to be using Operation Solar Fury as my grade 11 programming summative.

###Current Progress
Currently there are no releases. I am not the fastest programmer, and I am still working on the framework and engine as of now. I remain confident that there will be a release soon in the future however.
